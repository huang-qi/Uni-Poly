    "*CC(*)c1ccccc1": "Poly(1-phenylethylene), commonly known as Polystyrene (PS), is a versatile thermoplastic with the molecular formula C8H8 and a formula weight of 104.15 g/mol. Synthesized via radical addition polymerization of styrene monomers at 70Â°C under a nitrogen atmosphere, PS boasts a distinctive aromatic structure with phenyl groups. This unique arrangement imparts rigidity, excellent electrical insulation, and optical clarity to the polymer. Its key properties include low cost, ease of processing, transparency, and good thermal stability, making PS indispensable in consumer goods like packaging, disposable cutlery, insulation materials, and as a substrate for optical applications. The polymer's affordability and versatility underscore its extensive use across industries, from packaging to electronics, where its ability to be molded into complex shapes and its resistance to chemicals are highly valued."
