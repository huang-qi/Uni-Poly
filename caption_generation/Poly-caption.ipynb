    "\"Poly(1-methylethylene), or polypropylene (PP), is a lightweight, semi-crystalline polyolefin with the molecular formula C3H6 and a formula weight of 42.08 g/mol. Synthesized through the addition polymerization of propylene monomers, it features a unique isotactic arrangement of methyl groups that enhances crystallinity and strength. Known for its exceptional chemical resistance, thermal stability, and low density, PP is widely utilized in packaging, automotive parts, textiles, and household goods. Its durability, affordability, and versatility make it indispensable in applications requiring long-term performance and cost-effectiveness.\"\n",

    "\"Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a transparent, lightweight polymer belonging to the polyacrylic and polyvinyl classes, with the molecular formula C5H8O2 and a molecular weight of 100.12 g/mol. It is typically synthesized through radical addition polymerization in solution. PMMA features a rigid backbone structure with methyl ester functional groups, contributing to its exceptional optical clarity, mechanical strength, and resistance to UV radiation and weathering. These properties make it indispensable for applications such as optical lenses, protective transparent barriers, signage, and lightweight glass alternatives, particularly in architectural, automotive, and medical industries.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a biodegradable aliphatic polyester C3H4O2, is synthesized through the ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide. Distinguished by its renewable origin and biocompatibility, PLA features ester linkages that enable controlled biodegradation. It exhibits notable thermal processability and mechanical properties suitable for diverse applications. Widely utilized in biomedical fields for sutures, drug delivery systems, and tissue scaffolds, PLA's eco-friendly and thermoplastic nature also makes it an ideal material for sustainable packaging, disposable goods, and 3D printing.\"\n",
